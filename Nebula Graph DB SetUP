# 🌌 NebulaGraph Cosmic Explorer: Building an Employee Network

<div class="creator-info">Created by: Abhinand O M</div>

Welcome, space traveler! 🚀 Let's embark on an interstellar journey through the NebulaGraph universe. In this mission, we'll create a cosmic employee network using the power of graph databases.

## <span class="emoji">🛸</span> Mission Preparation: Setting Up NebulaGraph

First, let's summon our NebulaGraph spaceship:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vesoft-inc/nebula-docker-compose.git
cd nebula-docker-compose/
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

Now, let's board our console ship:

```bash
docker exec -it nebula-docker-compose-console-1 sh
/usr/local/bin/nebula-console -u root -p nebula --address=graphd --port 9669
```

## <span class="emoji">🌠</span> Creating a New Galaxy (Space)

Let's check our existing galaxies:

```ngql
(root@nebula) [(none)]> SHOW SPACES;
```

Result:
```
+------------+
| Name       |
+------------+
| "my_space" |
+------------+
```

Time to create a new galaxy for our employee network:

```ngql
(root@nebula) [(none)]> CREATE SPACE my_new_space(partition_num=10, 
                        replica_factor=1, vid_type=FIXED_STRING(30));
(root@nebula) [(none)]> show spaces
```

Result:
```
+----------------+
| Name           |
+----------------+
| "my_new_space" |
| "my_space"     |
+----------------+
```

## <span class="emoji">🌍</span> Entering Our New Galaxy

Let's navigate to our new galaxy:

```ngql
(root@nebula) [(none)]> use my_new_space
```

## <span class="emoji">👩‍🚀</span> Creating Cosmic Entities: Tags and Edges

Now, let's define our cosmic entities:

```ngql
(root@nebula) [my_new_space]> CREATE TAG employee(name string, age int, position string);
(root@nebula) [my_new_space]> CREATE EDGE works_with();
```

## <span class="emoji">🛰️</span> Populating Our Galaxy: Inserting Vertices and Edges

Time to add some stellar employees to our network:

```ngql
(root@nebula) [my_new_space]> INSERT VERTEX employee(name, age, position) VALUES 
                              "employee1":("Alice", 28, "Engineer"), 
                              "employee2":("Bob", 34, "Manager");
(root@nebula) [my_new_space]> INSERT EDGE works_with() VALUES "employee1" -> "employee2":();
```

## <span class="emoji">🔭</span> Observing Our Cosmic Entities: Fetching Properties

Let's take a closer look at one of our employees:

```ngql
(root@nebula) [my_new_space]> FETCH PROP ON employee "employee1" 
                              YIELD employee.name, employee.age, employee.position;
```

Result:
```
+---------------+--------------+-------------------+
| employee.name | employee.age | employee.position |
+---------------+--------------+-------------------+
| "Alice"       | 28           | "Engineer"        |
+---------------+--------------+-------------------+
```

## <span class="emoji">🚀</span> Career Advancement: Updating Vertex Properties

Congratulations, Alice! You've been promoted:

```ngql
(root@nebula) [my_new_space]> UPDATE VERTEX ON employee "employee1" 
                              SET employee.age = 29, employee.position = "Senior Engineer";
(root@nebula) [my_new_space]> FETCH PROP ON employee "employee1" 
                              YIELD employee.name, employee.age, employee.position;
```

Result:
```
+---------------+--------------+-------------------+
| employee.name | employee.age | employee.position |
+---------------+--------------+-------------------+
| "Alice"       | 29           | "Senior Engineer" |
+---------------+--------------+-------------------+
```

## <span class="emoji">🕳️</span> Black Hole Event: Deleting a Vertex

Oh no! Alice has been sucked into a black hole (or maybe just left the company):

```ngql
(root@nebula) [my_new_space]> DELETE VERTEX "employee1";
(root@nebula) [my_new_space]> FETCH PROP ON employee "employee1" 
                              YIELD employee.name, employee.age, employee.position;
```

Result:
```
+---------------+--------------+-------------------+
| employee.name | employee.age | employee.position |
+---------------+--------------+-------------------+
+---------------+--------------+-------------------+
Empty set
```

## <span class="emoji">🎓</span> Cosmic Lesson Learned

In this stellar journey, we've learned how to:
1. Create a new space (galaxy) in NebulaGraph
2. Define tags (entity types) and edges (relationships)
3. Insert vertices (entities) and edges
4. Fetch and update properties
5. Delete vertices

Remember, in the vast universe of graph databases, every node and relationship tells a story. Keep exploring, cosmic coder! 🌠
